This is my STEM fair progect.
This program will find all prime numbers between zero and the number that you give.
Prime numbers are numbers that you can only divide by one and itself. 
This program uses Sieve of Eratosthens algoritam for finding prime numbers.

To run this program you must put this into the terminal:

```
jshell --execution local --startup PRINTING "primeFinder.java"
```

The fix for primeFinder was that first you had to make scanner work (`--execution local`) and then enable printf function (`--startup PRINTING`)
